# Security Configuration and Best Practices

## Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` files to version control
- Use strong, unique secrets for JWT tokens (minimum 32 characters)
- Use different secrets for development and production
- Rotate secrets regularly

## Database Security
- Use strong, unique passwords for MongoDB
- Enable MongoDB authentication
- Use connection strings with authentication
- Regularly backup your database
- Consider using MongoDB Atlas for production

## HTTPS/SSL
- Always use HTTPS in production
- Obtain SSL certificates from a trusted CA (Let's Encrypt is free)
- Configure proper SSL/TLS settings
- Use HSTS headers

## Rate Limiting
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Configure appropriate limits for your use case
- Monitor for unusual traffic patterns

## CORS
- Configure CORS to only allow trusted domains
- Never use wildcards (*) in production
- Test CORS configuration thoroughly

## Input Validation
- Validate all user inputs
- Use express-validator for request validation
- Sanitize data before database operations
- Implement proper error handling

## Authentication & Authorization
- Use strong password requirements
- Implement proper session management
- Use JWT tokens with appropriate expiration
- Implement role-based access control
- Consider implementing 2FA for admin users

## Monitoring & Logging
- Log all security-relevant events
- Monitor for failed login attempts
- Set up alerts for suspicious activity
- Regularly review logs
- Use log rotation to manage disk space

## Dependencies
- Regularly update dependencies
- Use `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
- Consider using tools like Snyk for security scanning
- Pin dependency versions in production

## Docker Security
- Use non-root users in containers
- Keep base images updated
- Scan images for vulnerabilities
- Use multi-stage builds to reduce attack surface
- Implement proper secrets management

## Backup & Recovery
- Implement regular database backups
- Test backup restoration procedures
- Store backups securely
- Have a disaster recovery plan

## Network Security
- Use firewalls to restrict access
- Consider using a VPN for admin access
- Implement proper network segmentation
- Use load balancers with health checks
